## üõ†Ô∏è Some Cool Projects

**Most of my work is private**, but here are a few projects I can share:

### [IHK-Nachweis-Schreiber](https://github.com/WlanKabL/IHK-Nachweis-Schreiber)
**Tech Stack:** Node.JS

This script automatically generates training reports based on predefined data and templates. 
It is specifically designed to simplify the management of training records for the IHK vocational training system. 
With configurable settings and a structured file and folder setup, the script produces PDF files with essential information such as start and end dates, trainee name, department, and report number automatically filled in. 
The user only needs to manually input fields like "Betriebliche T√§tigkeit", "Unterweisung", and "Berufsschule," which can be done using tools like Jira and Untis "Mein Stundenplan."

### [RL-Shop-Tracking](https://github.com/WlanKabL/RL-Shop-Tracking)
**Tech Stack:** Node.JS

This project automatically scrapes the Rocket League shop webpage daily, extracting and storing new items. 
The script saves data under the `/data` directory, ensuring that duplicate entries are avoided by creating and storing checksums of the items. 
Each day, it captures new shop items, calculates a checksum for uniqueness, and archives only the checksum to maintain a clean and efficient data storage. 
This automation helped track the daily changes in the Rocket League shop, allowing for consistent and accurate data collection over time.

### [SurrealToCSharp](https://github.com/WlanKabL/SurrealToCSharp)
**Tech Stack:** Node.JS, C#, SurrealDB

This is a simple script that automates the process of generating C# class files from a SurrealDB database export. 
It extracts all tables and their respective properties from the SurrealDB export and automatically creates and populates the corresponding C# class files. 
While it's a straightforward tool, it streamlines the process of converting database schemas into C# class structures, saving time and effort in development.
